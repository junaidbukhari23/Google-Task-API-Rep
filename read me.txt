Google Task API

I used the following tools to implement google task API in web application.

1. PHPstorm 2016.3.2.
2. XAMPP server v3.2.1.
3. Laravel programming language (v5.4.15).
4. Composer

Open the terminal
> run the command  "php taskController.php"
> it will generate the link of google task.
> open the link in web browser.
> click on "allow" butten.
> code is generate in the text box.
> copy that code in commmand window of phpstorm/


Verification code??
> It is because of a folder with the name of ".credentials" in the path "C:\Users\abcPC" is create.
> In the .credentials folder a file with the name of "tasks-php-quickstart" is created.
> The file has the information of "access token".
